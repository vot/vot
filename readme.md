# Hi, I'm Vot

I write code. Lots of it.

I'm an enthusiast, advocate, contributor and consumer of Open Source, Open Access and Open Research.

I create tools to fix actual problems, I write sustainable code and maintain various services.

I value simplicity and elegance in code - the simpler your code is the easier it will be to maintain.

**Repos move update**

I created a few organisations recently to group my repos in a better way.

- [FFbinaries](https://github.com/ffbinaries) - ffbinaries-api, ffbinaries-node and ffbinaries-prebuilt finally got their own organisation
- [VotHub](https://github.com/vothub) - my web services and libs grouped together - includes Media Extractor API (previously _URLGent_), Media Converter API (previously _Great Converto_), Traffic Manager Hub + Agent (names stay the same) and HostIdent API (previously _Cyberpolice Lookup_)
- [OpenCoreCMS](https://github.com/OpenCoreCMS) - one more rename (previously _Open Publishing Platform_)
