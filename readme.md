# Hi, I'm Vot

I write code. Lots of it.

I'm an enthusiast, advocate, contributor and consumer of Open Source, Open Access and Open Research.

I create tools to fix actual problems, I write sustainable code and maintain various services.

I value simplicity and elegance in code - the simpler your code is the easier it will be to maintain.

**Repos move update**
I moved and renamed a lot of the repos into separate organisations.

- [ffbinaries](https://github.com/ffbinaries) - ffbinaries-api, ffbinaries-node and ffbinaries-prebuilt have been moved to their own organisation
- [media-extractor-api](https://github.com/vothub/media-extractor-api) - URLGent with a more fitting name; moved to vothub organisation
- [media-coverter-api](https://github.com/vothub/media-converter-api) - Great Converto with a more fitting name; moved to vothub organisation
- [traffic-manager-hub](https://github.com/vothub/traffic-manager-hub) and [traffic-manager-agent](https://github.com/vothub/traffic-manager-agent) - both moved to vothub organisation
